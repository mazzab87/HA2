            <h2>Different types of Extreme weather</h2>
            <p>Tornados - A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground, characterised by its violent winds and distinctive funnel shape. Tornadoes are among the most destructive weather phenomena, capable of causing severe damage in a very short time.</p>

            <p>Hurricanes, Typhoons and Cyclones</p>
            <p>Hurricanes - A hurricane is a large, powerful tropical storm system that forms over warm ocean waters, primarily in the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Pacific. It's characterised by strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surges that can cause flooding. </p>
            <p>Typhoons - A typhoon is a type of tropical cyclone, specifically occurring in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, particularly affecting East and Southeast Asia. Typhoons are essentially the same meteorological phenomenon as hurricanes, but they are referred to as "typhoons" when they occur in this region.</p>
            <p>Cyclones - A cyclone is a broad term for a type of storm system characterised by rotating winds around a central low-pressure area. It can refer to different types of storm systems, including tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, and polar cyclones, depending on where and how they form.</p>

            <p>Tsunami - A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves typically caused by significant underwater disturbances, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, or even meteorite impacts. These waves can travel at high speeds across the ocean and grow in height as they approach shallow coastal areas, causing devastating flooding and destruction when they reach land.</p>
